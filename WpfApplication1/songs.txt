Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment 
Would you capture it? Or just let it slip? yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's choking how, everybody's joking now 
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah! 
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that 
Easy, no 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes 
It don't matter, he's dope 
He knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stagnant that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo 
This whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo!

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar 
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dum da dum da da 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo!

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage 
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama's screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another day's monotony 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not this may be the only opportunity that I got 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
#end
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya'
And love is 'evol', spell it backwards, I'll show ya

Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but, I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller-coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, til' you toy with my emotions, so, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, 
I wasn't jokin' when I told you
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you
Right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take, let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake
'Cause I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you
Right at you
So after a year and 6 months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Til' I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't a possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star
'Cuz I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you
250, 000 miles and a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you
#end
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High of a love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait where you going I'm leaving you
No you ain't come back
We're running right back
Here we go again It's so insane
Cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind in his back
She's Lois Lane but when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed I snap who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom and these words
When you spit 'em you push pull each other's hair scratch, claw, bit 'em throw 'em down pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
Cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time there will be no next time
I apologize even know I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set the house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
#end
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road same road
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it,
I don't give a damn what you think,
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
Cause I ain't playing around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now! now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wantin my cake, and eat it too, and wantin it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew see, it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think cause I'm...
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's not fair,
Well, that's not fair...
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody
Once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin', sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll, do you wanders?
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think you've been wanderin' off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head
Keep knockin', nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well that's not fair,
Well that's not fair...
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
And I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood get spilled
And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at, pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who play 'em
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle feels and then relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that, straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts, I am nuts for real
But I'm okay with that, it's nothin', I'm still friends with the...
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well that's not fair,
Well that's not fair...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
Daddy look what I made, Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're lying
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying You've got one more chance to do right - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going
But baby wait, it's too late Dad, you made the choice
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand, in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When lay, with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire, to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire, to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well I fell something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire, to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well I fell something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, ooooooh

Oh, noo

Let it burn, ooh
Let it burn
Let it burn

#end

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I will remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I back, I will remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I back, I will remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I will remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah, yeah

There's a fire starting in my heart, 
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark.

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare, 
See how I leave with every piece of you, 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do. 

There's a fire starting in my heart, 
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark.

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
I can't help feeling, 

We could have had it all
You're gonna wish you, never had met me 
Rolling in the deep, 
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

Baby, I have no story to be told, 
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn, 
Think of me in the depths of your despair, 
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared, 

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
I can't help feeling, 
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

We could have had it all
You're gonna wish you never had met me 
Rolling in the deep.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

We could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep, 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door, 
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold, 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sow

You're gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all, 
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
We could have had it all.
You're gonna wish you never had met me, 
It all, it all, it all.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

We could have had it all, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

We could have had it all,
You're gonna wish you never had met me 
Rolling in the deep.
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
You're gonna wish you never had met me
But you played it, 
You played it, 
You played it, 
You played it to the beat.

Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss 'No way, it's all good', it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean when you talk about yourself you were wrong
Change the voices in your head make them like you instead

So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared so I
swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an
ice cold beer
So cool in lie, 
and we try try try, 
but we try too hard and 
it's a waste of my time
Don't looking for the critics, 
cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans 
they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves, 
and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
You're perfect, you're perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothin' you are perfect to me

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side 
High

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time

Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the Mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls
I see fire 
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall 
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in Mountain halls
We got too close to the flame

Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the Mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls
I see fire 
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire
Inside the Mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire 
Hollowing souls
I see fire 
Blood in the breeze

I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning out
And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin, yeah
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the Mountain side.

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love 
I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy 
And my heart is broken
I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!
Impossible, impossible!

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this 
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes  You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier  You played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right  to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall  I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall  I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall  I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give,
Should have known
you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash,
You tossed it in the trash, you did.
To give me all your love is all I've ever asked
Cause what you don't understand, is

I'd catch a grenade for ya yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw my hand on a blade for ya yeah, yeah, yeah
I'd jump in front of a train for ya  yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I'd do anything for ya yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same.

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are, yeah,
You'll smile in my face
then rip the brakes out my car.

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did.
To give me all your love is all I've ever asked
Cause what you don't understand, is

I'd catch a grenade for ya yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw my hand on a blade for ya yeah, yeah, yeah

I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same.

If my body was on fire,
oh you'd watch me burn down in flames.
You said you loved me you're a liar
cause you never, ever, ever did baby!

But darling I'll still catch a grenade for ya yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw my hand on a blade for ya yeah, yeah, yeah
I'd jump in front of a train for ya yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I'd do anything for ya yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, oh

Ooh, you'll never do the same.
No, no, no, no.

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

I never opened myself this way

All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you

Open mind for a different view

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High of a love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait where you going I'm leaving you
No you ain't come back
We're running right back
Here we go again It's so insane
Cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind in his back
She's Lois Lane but when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed I snap who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom and these words
When you spit 'em you push pull each other's hair scratch, claw, bit 'em throw 'em down pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
Cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time there will be no next time
I apologize even know I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set the house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

#end

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody
I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody

Judas! Juda-a-a, Judas! Ga-Ga

When he calls to me, I am ready
Ill wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o
Ill bring him down, bring him down, down
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o
A king with no crown, king with no crown

Im just a Holy fool, oh baby hes so cruel
But still I'm love with Judas, baby
Im just a Holy fool, oh baby hes so cruel
But still I'm love with Judas, baby

Woah woah woah woah woah

Judas! Juda-a-a, Judas! Juda-a-a,
Judas! Juda-a-a, Judas! Ga-Ga

I couldnt love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
Ive learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o
Ill bring him down, bring him down, down
Ah-ah-ahhh-ow uh uh o

Woah woah woah woah woah

Ew!

In the most Biblical sense,
I am beyond repentance
Fame, hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas kiss me if offensed,
Don't wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you,
But somethings pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue,
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

Just a Holy fool, oh baby hes so cruel
But still I'm love with Judas, baby
Im just a Holy fool, oh baby hes so cruel
But still I'm love with Judas, baby

Woah woah woah woah woah
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Woah woah woah woah woah

How can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb without a soul
My spirit's sleeping some where cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark

Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone 
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life 

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark

Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone 
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch, without your love
Darling only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Keep in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here, there must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone 
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road same road

Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it,
I don't give a damn what you think,
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
Cause I ain't playing around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now! now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...

I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road

It's fun to lose and to pretend.
She's over-bored and self-assured.
Oh no, I know a dirty word.

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey
Yeah

Im worse at what I do best 
And for this gift I feel blessed. 
Our little group has always been 
And always will until the end. 

Hello? hello? hello? How low.
Hello? hello? hello? How low.
Hello? hello? hello? How low.
Hello? hello? hello?

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey
Yeah

And I forget just why I taste. 
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile. 
I found it hard, it's hard to find. 
Oh well whatever, never mind. 

Hello? hello? hello? How low.
Hello? hello? hello? How low.
Hello? hello? hello? How low.
Hello? hello? hello?

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido,
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, 
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, 
A denial!

I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
Feeling so faithless 
Lost under the surface 
I don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure 
Of walking in your shoes 

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 

I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you 

Can't you see that you're smothering me 
Holding too tightly 
Afraid to lose control 
'Cause everything that you thought I would be 
Has fallen apart right in front of you 

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
And every second I waste is more than I can take 

I've become so numb 
I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you

And I know 
I may end up failing too 
But I know 
You were just like me 
With someone disappointing in you 

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired 
So much more aware 
I'm becoming this 
All I want to do 
Is be more like me 
And be less like you

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, well counting stars

I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, well be counting stars

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

I'm so tired of being here,
Suppressed by all of my childish fears,
And if you have to leave,
I wish that you would just leave,
Your presence still lingers here,
And it won't leave me alone!

These wounds won't seem to heal,
This pain is just too real,
There's just too much that time cannot erase...

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears,
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears,
And I've held your hand through all of these years,
But you still have all of me...

You used to captivate me,
By your resonating light,
But now I'm bound by the life you left behind.
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams,
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me.

These wounds won't seem to heal,
This pain is just too real,
There's just too much that time cannot erase...

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears,
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears,
And I've held your hand through all of these years,
But you still have all of me...

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone,
But though you're still with me,
I've been alone all along...

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears,
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears,
And I've held your hand through all of these years,
But you still have all of me...

#end

It's like you're screaming
And no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without him you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless
but nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good.

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I dont know why Im still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But youll always be my hero
Even though youve lost your mind


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie


Now theres gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war youll always win
Even when Im right
Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And its sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied


So maybe Im a masochist
I try to run but I dont wanna ever leave
'Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories


This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and Ill follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, Im nothing, Im so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that youll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that were on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each others backs
That well have each others backs, cause were that lucky
Together, we move mountains, lets not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but whos counting?
I may have hit you three times, Im starting to lose count
But together, well live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, were nuts, but I refused counselling
This house is too huge, if you move out Ill burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, aint shit you can do about it
Cause with you Im in my fucking mind, without you, Im out it

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick, you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, Worship in the bedroom.
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like theyre not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
Shes so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah
I know, I know
When I compliment her
She don't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she dont see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
Theres not a thing that I would change
Cause youre amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if shed let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy
Shes so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh,
You know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what youre searching for
Then just stay the same
So dont even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
Theres not a thing that I would change
Cause youre amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
Theres not a thing that I would change
Cause youre amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

Do you know what's worth fighting for?
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away?
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins...

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins...

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own?
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins...

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

A vision of ecstasy

I knew that wed become one right away
Oh, right away

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
Ive drowned and dreamed this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away Im stolen

Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But youll never have my heart

Let the sky fall Let the sky fall
When it crumbles When it crumbles
We will stand tall We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall Let the sky fall
When it crumbles When it crumbles
We will stand tall We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall

Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall  x2

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall Let the sky fall
When it crumbles When it crumbles
We will stand tall We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall Let the sky fall
When it crumbles When it crumbles
We will stand tall We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall

I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
say it on tape and lay it recording so that one day I can play it back
but I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
doubt's starting to creep in, everyday is just so gray and black
hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
when I play it for 'em they say it's wack
but they don't know what dope is
and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
all I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
you picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you, before the life in me
I don't see why you don't see like I do
but it just dawned on me, you lost a son D, it's fighting you,
it's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me not the slightest clue
cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you
will either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic, or you gon' hug me
but I'm out of options there's nothing else I can do, cause...

I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

It hurts, when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
you say they're just pieces of a puzzle, cause the shit I did is
crazy but you either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
seems like your own opinions not one you can form
can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
second guessing, and it's almost like you're begging for my help
like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand man you remember who you are
it was you who believed in me, when everyone was telling you
don't sign me, everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
you risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy tramp crying in this booth
you saved my life now maybe it's my turn to save yours
but I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
but I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me
GET UP DRE, I'M DYING, I NEED YOU, COME BACK FOR FUCK'S SAKE CAUSE

I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
bring me back to life
bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

It clearly feels like a lifetime ago
but I still remember this shit like it was just yesterday, tho
you walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, crack jokes,
once you got inside the booth, I told you, mic smoke,
went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
they said they was riding to the death
but where the fuck are they now
now that I need them, I don't see none of 'em
all I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
fucking backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
now you're 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath faggots
you gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we've been
you can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots, and the crackers ass
little crack a jack beat making wack math,
backwards producers, I'm back bastards
one more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving again
I'll guarantee they scream Dre don't leave us like that man cause...

I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

It starts with one...
One thing I don't know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
Its so unreal...
Didnt look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on but didnt even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Im surprised it got so far
Things arent the way they were before
You wouldnt even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end...

You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
Theres only one thing you should know...

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
Theres only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

I know the feeling of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing from cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
And take it from someone who's been where you're at
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
You can take this anymore

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes Close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you that you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done, you're far too young
And the best is yet to come

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes Close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well everybody's hit the bottom and everybody's been forgotten
Well everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned and left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hangin' on

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes Close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Talk to me softly 
There's something in your eyes 
Don't hang your head in sorrow 
And please don't cry 
I know how you feel inside, I've 
I've been there before 
Somethin's changin' inside you 
And don't you know 

Don't you cry tonight 
I still love you, baby 
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby 
And don't you cry tonight 

Give me a whisper
And give me a sign 
Give me a kiss before you 
Tell me goodbye 
Don't you take it so hard now 
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you 
And the times we had, baby 

And don't you cry tonight 
Don't you cry tonight 
Don't you cry tonight 
There's a heaven above you, baby 
And don't you cry tonight 

And please remember 
That I never lied 
And please remember 
How I felt inside now, honey 
You gotta make it your own way 
But you'll be all right now, sugar 
You'll feel better tomorrow 
Come the morning light now, baby 

And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby 
And don't you cry 
Don't you ever cry 
Don't you cry tonight 
Baby, maybe someday 
Don't you cry 
Don't you ever cry 
Don't you cry 
Tonight

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flag, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up, 
then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive

God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun

Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young
No!

Feeling my way through the darkness 
Guided by a beating heart 
I can't tell where the journey will end 
But I know where to start 
They tell me I'm too young to understand 
They say I'm caught up in a dream 
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes 
Well that's fine by me 

So wake me up when it's all over 
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
All this time I was finding myself and I
Didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel all the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young 
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone 
And love is the prize 

So wake me up when it's all over 
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
All this time I was finding myself and I
Didn't know I was lost 
I didn't know I was lost 
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

I've been roaming around always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Ooooo

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody

Go let it out, go let it out
Go let it out, go let it out
Go let it out, go let it out
Go let it out

Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody

I've been roaming around always looking down at all I see

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone
I walk a

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
When the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you dolike you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mhm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul
Can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's
Forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh

Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

You think I'm pretty without any make-up on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was all right
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February you'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Youuuu You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's runaway and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you, you don't just deserve me
I can't give you heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables

Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you, you don't just deserve me
I can't give you heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables

Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you, you don't just deserve me
I can't give you heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything
When will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down

I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowing up
Ringing my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love

One, two, three
One, two, three, drink
One, two, three
One, two, three, drink 
One, two, three
One, two, three, drink

Throw 'em back, till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now
Gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

Aaaaah

One, two, three
One, two, three, drink
One, two, three
One, two, three, drink
One, two, three

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in the nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause Im only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there
For you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

'Cause Im only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there
For you to see
For you to see

'Cause Im only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything else
I need to be

'Cause Im only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king

Eye to eye 
Cheek to cheek cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused, want to ask you if you love me,
But I don't want seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreamer

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've bet california wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king

Turn me on

I'm dancing with my boy
I see you walking to the party
Yeah, you're being nonchalant, laying low
Checking out my body
I can feel your eyes on me, I'm staying with the flow
Something 'bout you, baby, tells me everything I need to know

Yeah eh eh

Whoa-o-whoa, the way you turn me on turn me on

It's an automatic, I'm like a tragic addict
Don't you
Turn me on
Think that you need a little riddle down the middle, baby
Won't you
Turn me on
Take me for a ride, baby, I know you wanna go he he he
Something 'bout me, baby, tells you everything you wanna know

Whoa-o-whoa, the way you turn me on turn me on
Turn me on

What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face.
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor,
Couldnt take this anymore,
What would you do? do, do

Come, break me down.
Bury me, bury me.
I am finished with you.

What if I wanted to fight?
Beg for the rest of my life?
What would you do?
You say you wanted more,
What are you waiting for?
Im not running from you.

Come, break me down.
Bury me, bury me.
I am finished with you.
Look in my eyes,
Youre killing me, killing me.
All I wanted was you.

I tried to be someone else,
But nothing seemed to change.
I know now, this is who I really am inside.
Finally found myself.
Fighting for a chance,
I know now, this is who I really am.

Come, break me down.
Bury me, bury me.
I am finished with you, you, you.
Look in my eyes,
Youre killing me, killing me.
All I wanted was you.

Come, break me down.
Break me down.
Break me down.

What if I wanted to break?

I had a dream the other night,
About how we only get one life,
It woke me up right after two,
I stayed awake and stared at you ,
So I wouldnt lose my mind

And I had the week that came from hell,
And yes I know that you could tell,
But youre like the net under the ledge,
When I go flying off the edge,
You go flying off as well

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You've got something I need,
In this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

Last night I think I drank too much,
Yeah, call it a temporary crutch,
With broken words I tried to say,
Honey dont you be afraid,
If we got nothing we got us

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You've got something I need,
In this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

I know that were not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it to this time,
this time now

You've got something I need,
Yeah, in this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

And if we only die once,
I wanna die with...

If we only live once, I wanna live with you

And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken? 

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family.
In your head, in your head, they are fighting.
With their tanks and their bombs,
And their bombs, and their guns.
In your head, in your head, they are crying.

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey. 
What's in your head? 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey, hey

Oh, dou, dou, dou, dou, dou... 

Another mother's breakin', 
Heart is taking over. 
When the violence causes silence, 
We must be mistaken. 

It's the same old theme, since 1916.
In your head, in your head,they're still fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs, and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are dying.

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey. 
What's in your head? 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey, hey

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
hey, oh, ya, ya-a...
